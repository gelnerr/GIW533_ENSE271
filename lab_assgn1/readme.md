1. The general thought process behind my story mapping was me stepping into the shoes of a customer. I imagined myself placing an order for a 
grocery delivery using some arbitrary app, which helped me navigate which steps would be quintessential in making a grocery delivery app work.
It helps to have perspective from both what the user wants and what the developer may want to include.

2.1 - Decided to keep the story map concise, and not include more than necessary steps/tasks. This translated into the story board looking
clean and easy to interpret. I went with this because it'll keep things simple and also save time for the actual development process.

2.2 - Decided to have 3 releases. I arrived upon this decision from the fact that simply having more releases would give me more freedom
to experiment with feature feedback and test the market, see what the user likes. If I crammed this up into two 2 releases it would be
much more strenuous to reach (arbitrary) deadlines. This is clearly visible on the story map, with a few unplanned tasks.

2.3 - Gave more emphasis to steps which may have higher importance to users - such as Reach, Finding groceries (Main user experience) etc.
This resulted in some steps having more tasks than others, which gives out an imbalanced time estimate.

2.4 - The extra feature that was NOT discussed in the lab is personas. I found out about this feature through the worked example and
thought it was a fun little feature I could implement. I created 3 personas, all of whom have names and lil descriptions!
